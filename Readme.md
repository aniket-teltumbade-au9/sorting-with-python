Navigate to the desired directory in the terminal and execute the following command to run the "sorting.py" Python script:

```cd /path/to/your/directory && python sorting.py```

Replace "/path/to/your/directory" with the actual path to the directory where your "sorting.py" file is located. This command ensures that you change to the specified directory before running the Python script.
